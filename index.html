            <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Jean-Michel Basquiat was a jack of all trades: musician, graffiti artist and poet. But he is most famous for his paintings. Jean-Michel Basquiat gained celebrity due to both his striking art and his electrifying personality. Basquiat’s work is known as neo-expressionist. 
                He was fearless, creative and driven, quickly becoming a cultural icon embodying the New York City art scene of the 1980s and beyond. Not only is Basquiat still considered just as cool as he was back then, but his messages still resonate today, if not more.

            <h2>Chronology</h2>
                <h3>Early Life</h3>
                <p>
                    Born in Brooklyn on December 22, 1960 to a Haitian father and New York-raised Puerto Rican mother, Basquiat became a polyglot. By the age of 11 he was fluent in English, French and Spanish. 
                    At an early age, Basquiat showed an affinity for drawing, often using paper his father brings home from the accounting firm where he works to make drawings inspired by television cartoons. His mother has a strong interest in fashion design and sketching, and she frequently draws with Basquiat.
                    <br>
                    When he was 9 years old, Basquiat is hit by an automobile while playing ball in the street. He breaks an arm, suffers various internal injuries, and has to have his spleen removed. He is hospitalized at King’s County Hospital for one month. While recovering, he receives a copy of Gray’s Anatomy from his mother. The book makes a lasting impression; its influence is found in Basquiat’s later work with anatomical drawings and prints and in the name of the band he co-founded in 1979, Gray.
                    <br>
                    However, his childhood wasn’t easy. His father believed in corporal punishment, while his mother suffered from severe mental health issues, spending long periods of time in institutions — both influenced Basquiat’s art. Basquiat’s parents divorced in the early 1970's.
                </p>
                <h3>Teen Years</h3>
                <p>
                     Due to Basquiat's father's job promotion he and his siblings move to Mira Mar, Puerto Rico. This was a timultious time in Basquiat’s upbringing. Basquiat runs away from home, staying for a few hours at a local radio station until the employees call his father, who immediately brings him home. After a few years, they all move back to New York City. Basquiat transfers to the City-as-School, a progressive school in Manhattan. Part of the New York City public school system, the City-as-School is an alternative high school where work-study internships are accepted as credit toward a high school degree. Designed for gifted and talented children who find the traditional educational process difficult, it is based on John Dewey’s theory that students learn by doing. At City-as- School, Basquiat meets Al Diaz, a graffitist from the Jacob Riis Projects on the Lower East Side; they become close friends and early artistic collaborators. 
                     <br>
                     In just a few months after that incident, Basquiat again runs away, this time for about two weeks, hanging out in Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village, a place he and Diaz would often frequent. After much searching Gerard Basquiat, his father, finds him and brings him home. Basquiat proclaimed, “Papa, I will be very, very famous one day".
                     <br>
                     Through the City-as-School, Basquiat becomes involved with an Upper West Side drama group called Family Life Theater. During this time, he creates a fictional character named SAMO (Same Old Shit), who makes a living selling a fake religion. Basquiat and Diaz, among the most popular students at City-as-School, both very creative and with a knack for getting into a lot of trouble, begin collaborating on the SAMO project as “a way of letting off steam.” 
                     <br>
                     They begin spray-painting aphorisms on the D train of the IND line and around lower Manhattan. The writings consist of witty philosophical poems: SAMO as an end to mindwash religion nowhere politics, and bogus philosophy,” “SAMO saves idiots, Plush safe he think; SAMO.
                     <br>
                     At Diaz’s graduation from the City-as-School in June, Basquiat, on a dare, prepares a box full of shaving cream, and while the principal is speaking he runs up to the podium and dumps the box on his head. Although only a year away from graduating, Basquiat feels there is “no point in going back.” 

                </p>
                <h3>Young Adulthood and His Rise to Fame</h3>
                <p>
                    Despite attending this special school, Basquiat dropped out a year before graduation and lived on the streets of New York, supporting himself by selling hand-painted T-shirts, postcards and other paraphernalia while embarking on a solo street art career. During this time, he involved himself in the party and punk scenes, DJing at the Mudd Club, one of the most notable countercultural nightclubs of the time. He famously sold a postcard to Andy Warhol, who later became his mentor and friend.
                    lowly but surely, Jean-Michel Basquiat gained acclaim, not just for his marvelous art, but also for his spirited and dynamic personality. He frequently appeared on the live show TV Party and starred alongside Blondie’s Debbie Harry in the film Downtown 81, based on his life. Although the film wasn’t actually released until the year 2000, Basquiat was able to use the fees to finance his art and get in touch with key artists. His first artistic recognition, though, was the groundbreaking The Times Square Show in 1980, and he gained more and more traction after appearing in the group exhibition New York/New Wave. His graffiti tag dissipated as he started to nurture a global reputation and was the subject of an Artforum article entitled ‘The Radiant Child’. Basquiat’s works were displayed alongside influential artists in Italy, as well as in the illustrious Gagosian Gallery in LA, while he collaborated with leading artists like Warhol and Francesco Clemente.
                    <br>
                    In 1985, he was featured on the cover of The New York Times Magazine, under the title ‘New Art, New Money’. The piece focused on the concept of the ‘art star’, using Basquiat as a prototype of this artist-celebrity hybrid who became rich from his craft, and showed it off. This was a foreign idea at the time when the image of the starving artist was widespread, and fellow rich and famous painters, such as Jackson Pollock, were known to frequent grubby bars and show disdain for their wealth.
                    <br>
                    However, Jean-Michel Basquiat’s career was cut short due to his untimely death from a heroin overdose in 1988, adding his name to the tragic 27 club alongside Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin. He built his legacy in a mere 8 years, from an unknown graffiti artist to a renowned painter. 
                    <br>
                    That being said, his real call to fame came after his passing. In 2010, a film about him, aptly named The Radiant Child in homage to the article that kick-started his career, was released. Musicians still reference him constantly, with ‘Picasso Baby’ by Jay-Z being a notable example. Artists use him for inspiration to this day — Banksy’s Banksquiat from 2019, for instance. Basquiat has been featured in fashion and cosmetics, including collections at Supreme and Urban Outfitters and a make-up range from Urban Decay.
